I used this method and connect my device with the React-Native-CLI project.

Remind one Things your phone and Laptop should be on same Internet. 

First, I run the project and install the app on the device through the cable. (Only Once)

1.  Then gave this command in Terminal 
======>>>>     adb tcpip 1122 â€‹
(1122 is the port number .it can be changeable).

3.  Then,Remove the cable.

4.  Set IP Port number in mobile app that we installed. 
method:-
>>> Open the Installed App
>>> Shake the phone
>>> Menu will appear after shaking phone 
>>> Go to Setting 
>>> Go to Debugging Mode 
>>> Then set port no and Ip address

5. open Project Terminal again
Gave this command
>> adb connect 10.27.161.74:1122   
( 10.27.161.74 is IP address that you can get from your phone settings.>>>About phone>>Status>>IP address).
(1122 is port number that we set in previous step).

Then Run Project.

6. npx react-native run-android


Cheers........ :)
